BACKEND:
-it uses rest api , so put the backend code in eclipse / sts , or whatever you like

-change the database name in the application.properties, put ur name and password (psst: create the database first in ur mysql bench , here i used  gymData)

FRONTEND:
-it uses react js , so put the code in vs code (best tool imo) and you may need to install many things (just see what error it is and install it)

-states.jsx contains all the code functions, so any code ur changing in the components , dont forget to change it in states

Change the code however you like

tip 1 : go to signup.css and login.css , u will find two div in both pages , change the background img to whichever project (i used gym equipment here)

tip 2 : change the "iron fusion" in both signup.jsx and login.jsx to match your project (ex:chocolate factory)

tip 3 : go to backend and change the gym model in model folders like chocolate model , change all the names (gymId -> chocolateId etc...)

tip 4 : make sure to change the model table in states.jsx , admin.jsx , home.jsx , editgym.jsx , addGym.jsx

tip 5 : make sure to create firebase console and put ur firebase app id in firebase.jsx

tip 6: Be very careful about uppercase and lowercase
